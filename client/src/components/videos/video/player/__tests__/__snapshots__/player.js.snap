  <p>
    React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. - Just the UI: Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. Since React makes no assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, its easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project. - Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM diff implementation for ultra-high performance. It can also render on the server using Node.js — no heavy browser DOM required. - Data flow: React implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.
